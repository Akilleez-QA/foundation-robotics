# Documentation

Control documents carry their own baseline commits. Reading or indexing them does not create a new verification result. Classification: self-assessed Class E analog, not safety-critical; Class E holds only because no real engineering decision depends on this software. This is not a NASA compliance determination or certification (see the [software management plan](plan/software-management-plan.md#1-software-classification-self-assessed)).
